#HUNCH is a 'who-said-what' multi-player guessing game.

Given a random selection of topics, each user will submit their response.

After everyone has responded, each player has to match which user s/he suspects said each response.

Once everyone has matched each player to a response, the responses and their respective users will be revealed. Gain points for correct guesses!

Recommended 3 players minimum. You could play with only two players if you really wanted to, but it would be pretty easy to guess. You could also just play by yourself, but that doesn't sound like fun at all. I would instead recommend other fun activities to do independently, like reading a book or watching an entire season of Breaking Bad in a single sitting.
